let hairinfo = `Hair type is based on incomplete dominance.   There are two versions of the hair type gene, curly (C) and straight (s).  If you have one gene from each of the two hair types, you get a mix of curly and straight hair (wavy hair).  You either have CC hair (curly), Cs hair (wavy) or ss hair (straight). A child inherits one gene from each parent.`;
